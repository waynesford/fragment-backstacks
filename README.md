# Fragment Backstacks

This small project was inspired by [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6987334/separate-back-stack-for-each-tab-in-android-using-fragments) stackoverflow post, one of the very first things I looked up when I started android, and a post that's helped me alot.

I thought I would share how I've managed to do this using child fragments (this appeared one day in a support library revision, don't remember which one).

This project tries to accomplish having different tabs in an app, and having separate backstacks for each of those tabs.
